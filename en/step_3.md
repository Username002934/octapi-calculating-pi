## Why is calculating π difficult?

π is an **irrational number**. An irrational number is a number that cannot be written as a simple fraction. The decimal part is infinitely long and does not repeat.

Many people think that the value of π can be calculated by dividing `22/7`. This technique will only ever create an approximately true value, because π is an irrational number, so by definition it cannot be expressed this way (meaning as a ratio). `22/7` also has no mathematical basis in the geometry of circles — it is merely an attempt to represent the true value of π using memorable integers.

There are lots of irrational numbers. Two of the most commonly encountered ones are:
- `√2 = 1.4142135623730950488...`, which was the first number to be confirmed as irrational
- Euler's number e, the base value used in natural logarithms `e = 2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369995...`

The first formal method for calculating π was devised by Archimedes of Syracuse (287–212 BCE) around 250 BCE. It worked by fitting a circle between two polygons to try and estimating the length of the circumference of the circle using the perimeters of the polygons. The circumference (c) of the circle must be greater than the perimeter of the inner polygon, and smaller than that of the outer polygon.

We know the diameter (d) of the circle, and we can approximate c using the polygons. We also know that `c = π * d`. Therefore, we can estimate the value of π by rearranging the formula to `π = c/d`.

This method, or variants of it, was used by several mathematicians over several centuries, with astronomer Christop Grienberger for example calculating 38 decimal places in 1630 AD.
