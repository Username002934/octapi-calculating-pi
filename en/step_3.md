## Why is calculating π difficult?

π is an irrational number. An **irrational number** is a number that cannot be written as a simple fraction. The decimal part is infinitely long and does not repeat.

Many people think that the value of π can be calculated by dividing 22/7. This technique will only ever create a number that is approximately the true value because as π is an irrational number, and by definition it cannot be expressed this way. This ratio also has no mathematical basis on the geometry of circles, it is merely an attempt to represent the true value of π using memorable integers.

There are lots of irrational numbers, two of the most commonly encountered ones are:
- √2 = 1.4142135623730950488…, which was the first to be confirmed as irrational
- Euler's number, e, which is the base value used in natural logarithms, e = 2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369995...

The first formal method for calculating π was devised by Archimedes of Syracuse (287-212 BCE) around 250BCE and worked by fitting a circle between two polygons to try and estimate the length of the circumference of the circle using the perimeters of the polygons. The circumference of the circle must be greater than the perimeter of the inner polygon, but also less than that of the outer polygon.

This method, or variants of it, was used by several mathematicians over several centuries, Grienberger reaching 39 digits by the 17th century.
