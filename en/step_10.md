# Challenge

- How I wish I could calculate Pi. Try some "Pi Philology", find a sentence or paragraph where the number of letters in each word corresponds to the digits of π in the right order.
- Use your OctaPi to investigate the power of distributed computing! Why not learn about [Public Key Cryptography](http://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/octapi-public-key-cryptography) ?
- For more on the value of Pi, read: "Pi Unleashed" by Jörg Arndt and Christoph Haenel, Springer-Verlag, 2006, ISBN 978-3-540-66572-4. English translation by Catriona and David Lischka
