## Introduction

Calculate the value of π (pronounced "Pi") using the OctaPi distributed Raspberry Pi computer! You can complete most of this project with only a single Raspberry Pi, or any other computer running Python 3. Only the last part of the project requires an OctaPi (see the [Build an OctaPi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpi-python-build-an-octapi){:target="_blank"} resource).

### What you will make

The number π is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter: 3.141592... It has been represented by the Greek letter π since the mid-18th century.

The value of π is often used in mathematics, physics, and engineering, but it is an **irrational number** and therefore it's hard to use its actual value in accurate calculations.

Finding the value of π is important for science and engineering, but it is also an intellectual puzzle that has entertained mathematicians for centuries.
